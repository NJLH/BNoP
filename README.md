# Organiser for Suprise Nice Stuff

The plan is to have an app where I can list friends and 
it will pick someone that I have to do something nice for 
that week.

# Why?

I figure it could help to be less focused on myself and it 
should be nice for me too. 

# Features
- Users and log in
- Database of people and things they like
- Random emails to me

## Features I'll add if they're fun
- Tonnes of machine learning stuff to optimise how much you can make people happy
